Welcome to the week 1 assignment!!!

We have given you a historical dataset of udemy courses and your task is to create intuitive data visualization and find insights from the dataset.

YOU SHOULD USE THE DATA TO PRESENT HOW THE EDUCATION INDUSTRY AND FIELDS OF STUDY HAVE BEEN IMPACTED OVER THE YEARS.

To be more precise, the task can be further divided into subtasks as:
1. Clean, analyze and visualize given data set (3 pts)
2. Correlate with at least 1 other source of data that is not given in the dataset(4 pts). (It need not be a dataset but if you can correlate to how the trend in your dataset reflected in real-world organization or trends, that would be enough.)
3. Presentation(2 pts)
4. Uniqueness and aesthetic of plots along with understandability(1pt)

At the end of this week, I expect you guys to send in a PowerPoint presentation or a video along with your code/excel file.

Prerequisites:
